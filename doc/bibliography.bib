    abstract = "{We propose a method to invert surface wave dispersion data directly for 3-D variations of shear wave speed, that is, without the intermediate step of phase or group velocity maps, using frequency-dependent ray tracing and a wavelet-based sparsity-constrained tomographic inversion. A fast marching method is used to compute, at each period, surface wave traveltimes and ray paths between sources and receivers. This avoids the assumption of great-circle propagation that is used in most surface wave tomographic studies, but which is not appropriate in complex media. To simplify the problem we consider quasi-stratified media with smoothly varying seismic properties. We represent the 3-D shear wave speed model by means of 1-D profiles beneath grid points, which are determined from all dispersion data simultaneously using a wavelet-based sparsity-constrained tomographic method. The wavelet coefficients of the wave speed model are estimated with an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm, and upon iteration the surface wave ray paths and the data sensitivity matrix are updated using the newly obtained wave speed model. To demonstrate its feasibility, we apply the method to determine the 3-D shallow crustal shear wave speed variations in the Taipei basin of Taiwan using short period interstation Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion measurements extracted from the ambient noise cross-correlation method. The results are consistent with previous studies and reveal strong shallow crustal heterogeneity that correlates with surface geology.}",

    abstract = "{A compilation of compressional-wave (Vp) and shear-wave (Vs) velocities and densities for a wide variety of common lithologies is used to define new nonlinear, multivalued, and quantitative relations between these properties for the Earth's crust. Wireline borehole logs, vertical seismic profiles, laboratory measurements, and seismic tomography models provide a diverse dataset for deriving empirical relations between crustal Vp and Vs. The proposed Vs as a function of Vp relations fit Vs and Vp borehole logs in Quaternary alluvium and Salinian granites as well as laboratory measurements over a 7-km/sec-wide range in Vp. The relations derived here are very close to those used to develop a regional 3D velocity model for southern California, based on pre-1970 data, and thus provide support for that model. These data, and these relations, show a rapid increase in Vs as Vp increases to 3.5 km/sec leading to higher shear-wave velocities in young sedimentary deposits than commonly assumed. These relations, appropriate for active continental margins where earthquakes are prone to occur, suggests that amplification of strong ground motions by shallow geologic deposits may not be as large as predicted by some earlier models.}",

abstract = {We implement a method to invert jointly teleseismic P-wave receiver functions and surface wave group and phase velocities for a mutually consistent estimate of earth structure. Receiver functions are primarily sensitive to shear wave velocity contrasts and vertical traveltimes, and surface wave dispersion measurements are sensitive to vertical shear wave velocity averages. Their combination may bridge resolution gaps associated with each individual data set. We formulate a linearized shear velocity inversion that is solved using a damped least-squares scheme that incorporates a priori smoothness constraints for velocities in adjacent layers. The data sets are equalized for the number of data points and physical units in the inversion process. The combination of information produces a relatively simple model with a minimal number of sharp velocity contrasts. We illustrate the approach using noise-free and realistic noise simulations and conclude with an inversion of observations from the Saudi Arabian Shield. Inversion results for station SODA, located in the Arabian Shield, include a crust with a sharp gradient near the surface (shear velocity changing from 1.8 to 3.5 km s−1 in 3 km) underlain by a 5-km-thick layer with a shear velocity of 3.5 km s−1 and a 27-km-thick layer with a shear velocity of 3.8 km s−1, and an upper mantle with an average shear velocity of 4.7 km s−1. The crust–mantle transition has a significant gradient, with velocity values varying from 3.8 to 4.7 km s−1 between 35 and 40 km depth. Our results are compatible with independent inversions for crustal structure using refraction data.},

The method is used to compute phase and group velocities of Rayleigh waves for two assumed three-layer models and one two-layer model of the earth's crust in the continents. The computed group velocity curves are compared with published values of the group velocities at various frequencies of Rayleigh waves over continental paths. The scatter of the observed values is larger than the difference between the three computed curves. It is believed that not all of this scatter is due to observational errors, but probably represents a real horizontal heterogeneity of the continental crusts.}",

    abstract = "{We have developed a joint tomographic inversion method with seismic surface wave dispersion and gravity data for obtaining more reliable crustal 3-D shear wave structures. We take the eikonal-based direct surface wave tomographic method and adaptive gravity modeling method in spherical coordinates in the inverse problem. Based on the empirical relations between seismic velocity and density parameters, our method combines surface wave dispersion curves (i.e., surface wave travel times at different periods) and Bouguer gravity anomaly data together to invert for 3-D shear wave velocity structures. In our method, off-great-circle propagation of the surface wave and the earth's curvature is considered in the forward modeling. Synthetic tests suggest that the joint tomographic method could improve the reliability and obtain more convincing results than individual seismic surface wave tomography. The gravity data can provide more constraints into the model resolution and help restore the crustal anomalies better. The inversion results in the eastern Tibetan Plateau and Sichuan basin indicate complex distributions of low-velocity-zone in the mid-crust of the eastern Tibetan Plateau and a craton-like basement of the Sichuan basin, which supports the crust channel flow model. Although both the 3-D shear wave velocity model from joint inversion and the individual seismic surface wave inversion can fit the surface wave data almost equally well, the joint inversion model can better match the gravity data We also found that the 3-D model from joint inversion in this study shows similar structural characteristics with the surface wave tomographic model, which indicates the icing on the cake effects of gravity data.}",
