# Joint Inversion of Direct Surface Wave Tomography and Bouguer Gravity

## TODO List (from easy to hard)  

~~1. A more concise representation of station pairs with C++ class.~~

~~2. Parallelization of the computation of surface wave travetime and 2-D Frechet kernel.~~

~~3. Inhomegeneous grid in vertical direction.~~

4. Water layers could be involved in inversion. 

5. Different empirical relations for different region

6. Utilization of higher mode surface wave dispersion.
